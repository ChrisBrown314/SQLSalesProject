# SQLSalesProject
Designed and programmed by Christopher Brown

A program built to learn the basics of SQL.

### Project Description
Generates thousands of purchases which are written to and read from an SQL database.
Allows managers to sort through purchase data using different filters. 
Additionally, recommends an amount of products to purchase in order to maximize profits.

* Can generate data for 100,000 purchases in approximately 5 seconds.
* Can read and write to a mySQL database using JDBC library.
* Can generate recommendations for the amount of products to purchase each month in order to maximize gains and reduce or eliminate losses.
* Allows the viewing and sorting of all purchase data using a JavaFX GUI.

### Future Plans
* Allow managers to generate a weekly recommendation report.
* Increase modularity of the program - allow managers to create their own products and supplies.
* Create a more complicated - and accurate - algorithm for generating recommendations.
* Implement a login popup for logging into an SQL database as opposed to hard coding the login.
* Create a more in depth supply system.

### Additional Note
While this program can generate recommendations for purchasing products, 
this program is only a proof of concept and may not be accurate. I do not guarantee that these
recommendations are accurate nor do I guarantee that these recommendations will 
increase profits for your business.
